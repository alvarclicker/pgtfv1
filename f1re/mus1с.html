welcome to the music page here is where i will upload songs that you guys request and put them here. just dont put songs like that really popular song about 4 large dudes.
<br>
this is put in by genre and then the song when i get better at coding i will add a search page but not yet. also no pop music. i am adding mostly rap and hardbass to start with.
